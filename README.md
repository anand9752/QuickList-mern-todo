## :üîß Built With

- **MongoDB** - A NoSQL database used for storing user data and tasks efficiently. It allows for flexible data modeling and scalability, making it ideal for applications like Todo lists.
  
- **Express** - A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the backend of the application. It simplifies the server setup and allows for quick routing and middleware integration.

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used as the frontend of the application. It allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive components, providing a smooth user experience.

- **Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for server-side scripting. It enables the development of scalable network applications and allows the use of JavaScript for both client-side and server-side code.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - A compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In this application, it is used for user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources.

- **bcrypt** - A password hashing function that adds security to user passwords. It is used to hash passwords before storing them in the database, protecting user information from potential breaches.

- **Nodemailer** - A module for Node.js applications to allow easy email sending. In this application, it is used to send email notifications to users whenever they add a new task, keeping them informed and engaged.
